# DEVELOPMENT AND COMPLEXITY 

# Question 10:

Response Question: Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at uni-level? Was he successful? How significant were his results? 

Steve Jones worked at a company making soap powder. The soap power was made through mixing a wide array of chemicals together into a liquid and then using a spray nozzle to create enough pressure to crystallize the mixture and create the soap powder. The issue that he, and other scientists, faced was creating the most efficient nozzle that could create the most amount of product. There were other scientists that had worked on this for years and still could not get a model that worked more efficiently than the one that already existed. Instead of just sitting and trying to create new models of the nozzle, Jones made 10 copies of the already existing nozzle and began to randomly distort them. He then tested out each one and then  after several tries he ended up creating a nozzle that creates a 20& increase the efficiency of the nozzle, and it is still the most efficient to this day. 

Jones decided to take a leap of faith and distort and randomly put the piece back together. He came out successful and his findings were significant in the industry he worked in. This was used as an example of adaptive change that was talked about the Development and Complexity podcast. Which, like Owen Barder said “it doesn’t just bring about small improvements; it often brings about startling, game‐changing jumps to new solutions.” 

# Question 3: 

Response Question: What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaite attempt to do? Was he successful? What is the significance of these examples in the content of complexity? 

Thomas Thwaite, a British designer, wanted to build a toaster from scratch. He wanted to gather all the raw material to make the toaster and then put it together to make a functional toaster. In the end it took him around 9 months to finish making a toaster that did not work and ended up catching on fire. 

The toaster project started with Thwaite buying a cheap toaster and disassembling it. He took it apart to see all the parts he would need to buy or make in order to build his own toaster. He called it a “partial success” since it worked but then caught on fire. Thwaite was able to  demonstrate how an object that is simple and mondain  could be created with such complexity and with the use of various technologies. This is also an example of how development is not an increase in output by an individual's form but as a collective output by multiple individuals forms.
