Through the course of Jahan’s podcast he explained how there is a preconceived notion around the world that income has the biggest impact on human development within a nation. This may seem like a correct assertion because wealth can make an individual's standard of living just better but we must acknowledge that focusing on health care, educatio, and public resources first and then focusing on the wealth of a nation will be more beneficial.

The focus measure uses 3 different indicators to assert human development which has a long and healthy life, knowledge,and a decent standard of living.

Bothtackeled the perconsieved notion of human devlepement being driven by wealth first instead of by social factors. Through his statistics of comparing first and third world countries he was able to show that in the past third world countries did have issues with helath and many thought they this was because of the levle of income that the country had.
