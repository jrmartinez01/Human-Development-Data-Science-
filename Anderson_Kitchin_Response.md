In the readings presented by Anderson and Kitchin, the idea of theories with relation to big data is questioned. In the article “The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete.” Anderson establishes the idea that the increase in data collection and algorithms have made it so theories no longer need to be used in order to reach a target audience. His argument makes sense when looking at the amount of data that has been collected since the beginning of internet data collection. It has led to such an increase that new methods of storage, such as disk array and the cloud, were created. With this amount of data, Anderson’s argument should be considered. The increase in computer technology has enabled the opportunity for machines to gather this data and create algorithms to demonstrate the  importance of the data. This leads to a decrease in need to create a theory as to what the data could be representing, This poses advantages and disadvantages.   

This new approach to big data allows for social scientists and humanistic scholars to increase opportunities in terms of analyzing social, political, and historical data. Opportunities that would not be present otherwise. Kitchin’s article emphasizes the importance of big data in today’s market but realizes ”the urgent need for wider critical reflection in the epistemological implications of Big Data and data analytics.” This point of view is the one that, to me, seems more logical. Although there is no need for a theory to be established to analyze and interpret data , it should still be a step within the research progress. It would allow for a more focused and oriented research topic and would allow for analyzes of big data as well as small data studies. I believe we have entered a paradigm shift revoked for how we describe, analyse, and understand the world. It is a shift that is justified when realizing just how much data we have and how it should be analyzed. The best approach to this new shift should be to embrace it but also keep in mind the benefits that are still seen from the old method of using theories, especially in order to gauge deeper and more focused understanding of the conclusion found from this data collection.
