# Jahan and Rosling Reponse 
Jasmin Martinez 

Through the course of Jahan’s podcast he explained how there is a preconceived notion around the world that income has the biggest impact on human development within a nation. This may seem like a correct assertion because wealth can make an individual's standard of living just better but we must acknowledge that focusing on health care, educatio, and public resources first and then focusing on the wealth of a nation will be more beneficial. This would allow a much faster and long term approach to maintaining the human development of a nation and increase other economic, social, and (possibly) political factors. Jahan defines human development as the process of enlarging human choices in every aspect. The Human Development Index (HDI) is known as the “crown jewel” to tracking human development globally. Although Jahana did mention that there is no way to fully track the progress of human development on such a large scale, the HDI gives a good idea of each nation’s progress. The HDI uses two types of measures: a breath measure and a focus measure. The breath measure is essentially just superficial indicators of human development, such as GDP and income. The focus measure uses 3 different indicators to assert human development which has a long and healthy life, knowledge,and a decent standard of living. These two measures can be used for distinct purposes and offer different insights in the development that is going on in different countries around the world.  

Hans Rosling described his research on an issue that Jahan had previously explained. Both tackled the preconceived notion of human development being driven by wealth first instead of by social factors. Explained the “We vs. Them” concept, which is how many first world countries view third world countries and themselves. They view first world countries as mainly comprised of people with long lives and a small family, where third world countries are comprised of people with short lives and a large family. Through his statistics of comparing first and third world countries he was able to show that as a third world country invested in health, it led to people with longer lives and smaller families. This change helped to prove that a social change in a nation is much more impactful than an economic change and beavcsue of this nations should invest in civilian care first and then work towards economic growth. 

This was interesting for me to hear about because I was able to recall my personal experiences and knowledge while he explained how this could work. Global Brigades is an example of an organization that helps a nation build these resources to promote civilian care and then introduces resources to help economic growth in rural communities and the nation as a whole. Overall, Jahana and Rosling were able to introduce new ideas and break preconceived notions that are no longer true in the world.
