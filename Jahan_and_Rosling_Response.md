Through the course of Jahan’s podcast he explained how there is a preconceived notion around the world that income has the biggest impact on human development within a nation. This may seem like a correct assertion because wealth can make an individual's standard of living just better but we must acknowledge that focusing on health care, educatio, and public resources first and then focusing on the wealth of a nation will be more beneficial. This would allow a much faster and long term approach to maintaining the human development of a nation and increase other economic, social, and (possibly) political factors. Jahan defines human development as the process of enlarging human choices in every aspect. The Human Development Index (HDI) is known as the “crown jewel” to tracking human development globally. Although Jahana did mention that there is no way to fully track the progress of human development on such a large scale, the HDI gives a good idea of each nation’s progress. The HDI uses two types of measures: a breath measure and a focus measure. The breath measure is essentially just superficial indicators of human development, such as GDP and income. The focus measure uses 3 different indicators to assert human development which has a long and healthy life, knowledge,and a decent standard of living. These two measures can be used for distinct purposes and offer different insights in the development that is going on in different countries around the world.  

Hans Rosling described his research to an issue that Jahan had previously explained. Bothtackeled the perconsieved notion of human devlepement being driven by wealth first instead of by social factors. Through his statistics of comparing first and third world countries he was able to show that in the past third world countries did have issues with helath and many thought they this was because of the levle of income that the country had. But then as we saw the
