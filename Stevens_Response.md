The Stevens et al. reading used a technique to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe known as the random forest method. The random forest method works with an algorithm which consists of a large collection or non-correlated decision tree. It works by using a sample set and creating multiple subsets with random values, this allows to create a decision tree and creating many decision trees allows for different variation of the main classifications which can then be used to create a ranking of the classifiers. 

A machine learning algorithm is an algorithm which takes big data and analyzes it to perform certain tasks or analysis. With machine learning algorithms, the more data is collected the more ‘learning’ can be done and the programs can adjust themselves to perform better. The main difference between machine learning methods (such as random forest) and other statistical approaches of analysis is the use of the data within both aspects. Machine learning methods allow us to input the data and create solutions without maybe even knowing a problem. Since the algorithms are able to adjust programs, problems to fix can be seen in ‘real-time’ and therefore solutions can be found before the problem is out of control. In other statistical models, a problem to solve is usually considered first. Then, the data is collected and analyzed with the hopes of finding a solution to said problem. 

The geospatial covariates can be found on page 4 of the reading. It includes classifiers of  different areas of land (such as “woody/tree, urban area, bare area, water bodies, industrial area”), classifiers of rasters (such as “light at night, elevation, slope, mean temp./precipitation), classifiers of population present in areas (such as “ cities, villages, suburbs, and towns”), and classifiers of facialites (such as “ health clinics, hospitals, and schools). Each covariates consisted of (mostly) three large data sets. Each data set represented the whole country being analyzed (that is: Cambodia, Vietnam, and Kenya). 

Big data is significant in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of human population distribution. This is because the more data that is put into the algorithms allows us to see the changes each individual country is facing. It also allows us to distinguish the needs of each country, which allows for aid to be distributed according. Since Cambodia, Vietnam, and Kenya face distinct problems for their respective populations, it’s important to recognize that and aim to solve these problems in a way that is realistic for each one of them. It is important for human development in LMICs to have highly accurate description of where people live across the Earth because it allows for a correct distribution of aid and help for everyone. The more accurate the data is, the easier it is to help those who are in need across the world.  

With respect to my area of investigation, human migration from Central America to the US and from Northern Africa to Europe, a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located is crucial. This is because with accurate numbers of the location of each person, it would be easier to see changes in numbers between countries and acknowledge migrants' home and destination countries. With a more accurate number, resources can be created or better for these migrants in new destination countries or solutions can be created to better the situations in home countries to  prevent migrants from leaving in the first place. More accurate data would also allow nonprofits to determine how many migrants have passed away while trying to migrate to their destination country and the correlation between an increase in security leads to an increase in mortality rate at these borders.
