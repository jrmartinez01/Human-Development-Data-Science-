# Problem Statement 

Migration has been seen throughout centuries around the world. It has led to diversity and has given allowed cultures to interact with one another. Migrants face a hard decision when deciding to leave their home countries due to economic, social, and political constraints and inequalities. To expand their real freedoms, migrants migrate to destination countries that provide a greater opportunity to increase these freedoms and progress in human development. I focused on two areas where migrant crossing has increased since the early 2000s, the U.S.-Mexico border and between Africa and Europe. 

These two borders have seen an increase in security and surveillance over the years due to the influx of migrants from the south. This increase has led to a “funnel effect” and pushed migrants to travel on routes that are more dangerous and high risk. I focused on the topic of human migration patterns to investigate if a correlation between increased security and increased mortality existed. This question arose from considering why these migrants are immigrating and the sustainable development goals that are being met and who they benefit. Migrants tend to leave their home countries to end poverty (SDG #1), receive quality education (SDG #4), and reduce the overall inequalities that are present in their nations (SDG #10). While trying to do this they are faced with increase innovation and infrastructure (SDG #9) at these borders, which forces them to find alternative ways to enter these destination countries. This shows how the increase in sustainable development and human development poses both a positive and negative facet to both migrants and destination countries. Which is a factor and correlation that many fail to realize occurs at these borders, which complicates policies made and the journey that must be made by these migrants and refugees.

In the report “Who’s crossing the border: new data on undocumented immigrants to the United States,” data from the Enforcement Case Tracking System (ENFORCE) is used to create geospatial maps explaining the change of migration patterns in Mexico. The report focused on only undocumented migrants coming into the U.S. from Mexico who were apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border. Those who were apprehended were asked a series of questions that included information about the person’s name, age, sex, country of citizenship, and place of birth. This ENFORCE data was later combined with census data, collected by the Mexican government, to create a Migration Propensity Index (MPI), which explained the reasons migrants decided to leave the states in Mexico. 

The report looked at migration from the years 1999 to 2006. In earlier years, the top four migrant-sending states were Jalisco, Michoacán, Guanajuato and Zacatecas- all states that are in Northern Mexico and close to Mexico City, the nation’s capital. From 2000-2006 there was a 10% increase in the number of migrants arriving from Chiapas, Tabasco, Campehce, Yucata, and Quintana Roo- all of which are states south of Mexico City. The reasoning behind the shift in migration and the increase in migrates from the south was found through the census and the MPI. The variable for leaving that was significant in all years of the study was the death rate from violence and accidents. States with increased violence had an increase in propensity, this introduces the factor of protective security. Many migrants do not feel safe in their communities and this lack of protective security could lead to a decline in education, economic, and social opportunity and freedoms which help drive human development. The other significant reason for leaving the southern states was due to low levels of infrastructure and standards of living. The lack of improvements in these two areas correlated to a lack of electricity and sewer systems, which in turn could lead to a lower quality of life and creates unfreedom in sanitary arrangements. 

This report demonstrates the Sustainable Development Goals of good health and well-being, decent work and economic growth, and industry, innovation, and infrastructure. If Mexico's government increased infrastructure for its citizens and provided a way to decrease violence within the nation then there could potentially be a decrease in migration for Mexico in the United States and would impact the human development of Mexican citizens without the need to leave their beloved homes.

Previously, the demographics of Mexican migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border from 1999-2006 were taken into consideration. The data was collected from the apprehensions made at the border. In “The Effects of Geospatial-Intelligence on United States-Mexico Border Security” report the U.S. interpretation of the securitization theory and increase in geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) is introduced to address the increase in security on the U.S.-Mexico border. The securitization theory emphasizes an extraordinary means to be used in the name of security, which has been seen at the southern border since the event of 9/11. In this report data from GEOINT, which provides situational awareness of crossings, and Customs Border Patrol (CBP) was used to create geospatial maps demonstrating the “operation control of the border” and displaying areas where illegal crossing was occurring. The main focus of this report was the illegal entries correlated with drug crime and the research recognized that free migration should be provided to those escaping situations which prohibit their freedoms and hinder human development. 

From the research, it was found that there was a correlation between increased manning and funding and a decreased apprehension rate at the border. This increase in manpower and the use of technology to secure the border has provided a perception that the border is a dangerous place and has added to the narrative of a “border crisis” present at the southern border. This has led many Americans to fear the entry of migrants from the south and many migrants to fear apprehension and detainment at the border. This fear instilled in migrants along with the increase in manning has not stopped migrants from crossing. These two factors have increased the number of attempts at crossing before successful and has sparked an increase to cross in larger groups to increase the chance to escape if caught. These factors have also led to migrants deciding to cross at areas which are more isolated and dangerous to go unnoticed, which has, unfortunately, increased the number of fatalities at the U.S.-Mexico border. 

The increase in securitization at the U.S.-Mexico border has arisen from a harsher political system and has decreased the capabilities of migrants to move across the border safely. The decrease in capabilities for migrants has not only led to an increase in mortality but also a decrease in human development globally. The reasoning for migration, explained in the previous report, demonstrates the need for good health and well-being (SDG #3) of these migrants. Without the opportunity to move freely and safely across borders the increase in mortality is expected and with that global human development or even within the destination nations of migrants cannot be fully met.

In the previous report, the increase in security at the southern border was definitely seen. In this report, the correlation between the increase in security and change in migration routes was demonstrated. This increase in security has led to a “funnel effect,” forcing migrants to travel through areas of high risk which has resulted in an increase in mortality at the southern border. The study analyzed data from 1994 to 2015 and looked at an area of 259,981 hectares along the Arizona/Sonora border between the cities of Arivaca, Arizona and Sasabe, Sonora. The research used data from SBInet and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) measure the surveillance present in this area and the total caloric cost (TCC) to cross into the U.S. Then, the total mortality on these routes was analyzed and a correlation was established. 

The research found that the increase in surveillance between the region led to a 20-fold increase in death and the disappearance of migrants. Within the area of investigation, 49 mortalities were found and documented. Around these morality sites, least cost paths (LCP) and diverted least cost paths (DLCP) were found which allowed for the calculation of TCC on these routes. On the LCP, the mean TCC was 3281.47 while on the DLCP the mean TCC was 4207.45. In recent years, the increased surveillance has forced migrants to travel on these DLCPs which in turn has led to deaths caused by “exposure to the elements- dehydration, hyperthermia, and physical exertion.”  Physical exertion accounted for 45% of all recorded migrant deaths, and with the TCC seen on the DLCPs along with the environmental risks present, it makes sense. 

This increase in border security was pushed by CBP, it was thought that the migrants would assess the risk and abandon efforts to cross the border and migrate towards the U.S. Instead of this, the outcome was the “funnel effect” and now migrates must face these dangerous terrains and risk their lives to increase their access to freedoms. This increase in mortality is not only seen in the migration patterns from Latin America to the U.S. but also in the migration from Africa to Europe, which will be discussed later. These journeys are made to ensure the opportunity to receive freedoms such as economic and educational benefits to help increase human development. The investment in industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG #9) along the southern border has helped the U.S. decrease drug smuggling into the nation from the south but unfortunately has come at the cost of human lives.

The migration of people from Latin America to the United States was seen from 2000-2009, today there is still a great number of migrants crossing the southern border every year. Europe has also seen an increase in migrates from Africa arriving in recent years, the biggest spike seen in 2015. Refugees that have arrived in Europe are mostly from the Middle East, with a majority coming from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. In this report, geo-tagging is used to identify the refugee migration patterns from the Middle East to Europe. The data is collected from Twitter and is composed of the user name, creation time and date, position coordinates, and hashtags. The hashtags were the main source to find refugees and once tweets posted by these refugees were found, the position coordinates could be used to track the pattern of migration. For a tweet to be considered part of the data set there must be a tweet posted in at least one location outside of Europe followed by a location in Europe. Although a limitation is observed since not all refugees are twitter or access to it, there may be a variation in migration patterns between those who use twitter and those who don’t but the study still allows to display generalized patterns of migration by these refugees. 

The main conclusion of the report was that the primary refugee route was along the Mediterranean Sea into port cities in Greece. Distance-bounded eventing clustering was used to conclude this with the help of geo-tags from tweets of refugees. This also increases the thought of the danger associated with this form of travel and how increased security at sea can harm asylum-seekers and refugees making this journey. The drive to understand these migration patterns is mainly for administrative logistics, which include accommodation, transportation, education, and distribution of refugees. All efforts to help refugees develop in these European countries that are unknown to them. By increasing the quality of life for these refugees in these new nations there is an expansion of freedoms related that also help to increase global human development. With this, refugees can expand their social, economic, and political freedoms. But one must also consider the excessive amounts of risks that come with this form of travel, such as getting lost and becoming victims of trafficking and robbery. This report gives a good insight into the migration patterns and routes taken by these refugees and also takes into consideration the tenth UN sustainable development goal, reduced inequality. These refugees are leaving their home countries due to war and political and economic injustices. The need for equality and an increase in freedoms is prevalent and if these refugees do not leave they could face life-threatening circumstances, which makes the risk of travel to Europe the only choice.

The increased surveillance and security present at the border has been seen around the world. The U.S.-Mexico border and the Medditariend Sea, which is a physical border between Africa and Europe, are examples of borders which have had an increase in human migration and security. This increase has stopped drug smuggling, which has helped improve the security and well being of the citizens of destination countries as well as migrated but has also caused an increase in mortality. These security measures have forced migrants to find routes that have less patrolling, which typically are more dangerous and life-threatening areas.   

The Missing Migrant Project has collected data from government authorities, media, the UN, and NGOs to track morality along migratory routes around the world. I focused on the conclusions made from migratory routes between Mexico and the U.S. and Africa and Europe. It was found that of the total fatalities of migrants worldwide in 2016, 75% were centered in the Mediterranean. The migratory route with the second-highest rate of materiality in 2016 was at the U.S.-Mexico border with 6% of the global fatality of migrants. The geospatial maps presented in the report shows how the increase in innovation and infrastructure at these borders came at the cost of human lives. Humans, who were aiming to seek freedoms which they were deprived of in their home country. Without these freedoms, human development could not occur and unfortunately many governments fail to realize that an increase in security will not decrease migration, but more push migrants into life-threatening situations that can only end in tragedy.
