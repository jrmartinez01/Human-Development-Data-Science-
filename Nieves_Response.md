# Nieves Reading Response

The random forest model works by using a sample set and creating multiple subsets with random values, this allows to create a decision tree and creating many decision trees allows for different variation of the main classifications which can then be used to create a ranking of the classifiers. More especially the method from the paper “takes individual decision trees that are considered ‘weak learners’ and combine[s] them to create a ‘strong learner’.” From the Nieves reading the random forest machine learning can be used to predict the different covariates that are important in different nations across the world. This in turn allows for non-profits and the government of each nation to allocate the correct resources for their countries. A dasymetric population allocation aggregates census data and splits the data into regions/boundaries then places population density values on top in order to analyze the needs of each section more accurately. In order to measure how important geospatial covariates when predicting values of where humans reside the weight important rank (WIR) was used. The most important covariate was urban/suburban extents.
